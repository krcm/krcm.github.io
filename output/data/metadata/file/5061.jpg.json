One sees from the train a ruddy cliff, rising to a height of several hundred feet, known as Simpson's Rest. Upon its top a party of pioneers were besieged by Indians in the early days and one of the survivors, named Simpson, chose to be buried there many years after, when his time came to die. A rude monument surmounts Simpson's Rest and may be seen from the train. Trinidad is the county seat of Las Animas County. Altitude 5,982 feet.
